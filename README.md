# Munybud - your friendly CLI finance manager

This project will be exactly what the title says: a CLI finance manager.

The main goals are, besides obviously getting a grip on myself and my stupid spending habits, to have a easily accessible and no bullshit method to track my spendings and incomes and to learn about using JSON files and making CLI apps.
